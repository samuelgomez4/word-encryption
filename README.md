Challenge for oracle ONE program.

The encryption "keys" that we will use are the following:

`The letter "e" is converted to "enter"`
`The letter "i" is converted to "imes"`
`The letter "a" is converted to "ai"`
`The letter "o" is converted to "ober"`
`The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"`

**Requirements:**
- It should work only with lowercase letters.
- Letters with accents or special characters must not be used.
- It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version also to return an encrypted word to its original version.
